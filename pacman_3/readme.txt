- Implemented model-based and model-free reinforcement learning algorithms;
	value iteration and Q-learning. 
- Tested the agents first on Gridworld (from class)
- Then apply them to a simulated robot controller (Crawler) and Pacman.
- Main files:
	valueIterationAgents.py: A value iteration agent for solving known MDPs.
	qlearningAgents.py: Q-learning agents for Gridworld, Crawler and Pacman.
