- Probabilistic inference in a hidden Markov model tracks the movement of hidden ghosts in the Pacman world.
- Implemented exact inference using the forward algorithm and approximate inference via particle filters.
- Pacman agents that use sensors to locate and eat invisible ghosts
- advanced from locating single, stationary ghosts 
	to hunting packs of multiple moving ghosts with ruthless efficiency.
